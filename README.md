# BookSwap

This project was inspired by a take-home test suggested on the free code-camp webisite (https://www.freecodecamp.org).
For people who want to brush up on their skills and learn new ones, I would highly recommend visiting this site.

The requirements for the test/challenge was that it fullfill the following user stories:

  * User can view all books posted by every user.

  * User can add a new book.

  * User can update their settings to store their full name, city, and state.

  * User can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.
  
I used a Redux state tree to persist data throughout the site by saving it to local storage under 'appState'. This 
will allow page refresh without losing data making it feel more like a session.

I deployed the code in this repo to Netlify, where it is available to be seen here: https://eclectic-haupia-8a69c6.netlify.app/
